While procrastinating, I reflected on a few memorable moments of 2016. With another year come and gone, it‚Äôs surreal to think that for the class of 2017, **it‚Äôs 2017**. In four months I will know my university decisions. In six months I will have graduated. In nine months I will have moved into a completely new town.

This year, I am going to try to document as much as my life as possible. I think I often forget about the happiness, blessings, and sheer joy of living the life I do amidst sleep-deprivation, stress, and pressure. To start, here‚Äôs a look back at my favourite memories of 2016:

**January:** My birthday! I still remember going out for sushi with my brother and mom after finishing an Econ exam (plus Mr. Nicholson blessed me a chocolate bar). Also saw the school musical for the second year in a row #NWIYCGI

**February:** Got to see many of my SHAD friends again at DECA Provs

**March:** The annual skating + sushi get together

**April:** Went downtown for a college expo and probably blew $50 on the GO bus, lunch, ice cream, and Muji pens (no regrets)

**May:** Nocturne 2016 ‚Äì discovering my love for the minimalist aesthetic in poster making

**June:** Finishing 3/4 of high school

**July:** Junior Team Canada‚Äôs Trade Mission to China: Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, and Hong Kong. Four cities (and like six flights) in three weeks was rough. Late nights and long mornings = crashing right when we got on the plane. I‚Äôll always remember getting stuck in a thunderstorm for three hours, hauling 1kg worth of notebooks back home, space, hiking Victoria‚Äôs Peak (and almost doing it again for the nightlife views), paying 25 yuan to hop on the back of a golf cart and top dollar to eat noodles every day, forcing people to geocache with me in Hong Kong, getting scammed in the black market, and dying from stomach aches from the spicy hotpot. RIP coin pouch, blazer, and blue muji pen

**August:** Wonderland. Trekking to Hamilton for a sleepover and missing a BBQ in the process. Learnt I was really bad at taking candid photos

**September:** üôÇ

**October:** 1) Missing too many socials for college applications. 2) Submitting my first college application

**November:** Europe 2016: Greece, Italy, and Spain. Cheating the system and winning three bags of chips before our flight, talking about the future instead of sleeping on a flight, dabbing, seeing Mr. Whiler in the middle of Athens, not getting seasick on either ferry, climbing the *Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Flowers* (twice), paying 9 euros for gelato, paying 1 euro for the toilet, paying 100 euros for even more notebooks, carrying two 1L babies, buddies, and ‚Äúshopping‚Äù with Daisy

**December:** Getting a new phone #teamwatergun, finishing my first and last high school swim meet and accidentally disqualifying my relay team, staying up all night to build a molecule, and spending half my Christmas break doing work!

Despite all the allnighters pulled, classes missed, and years of my life lost, 2016 was a not too bad. All the best for the new year!
