Becoming a senior in high school was when I finally realized a sense of responsibility and mentor-ship. People actually look up to me for guidance and support, whether it be what classes to take next year or how to write an application for a summer program. It’s a weird feeling, being old. I’m struck with how fast I got here and how fast life will continue to progress. Walking through the Math hall, I still remember taking my first high school exam on my birthday four years ago – BTT1DG. Now, I’ve finished high school math and will be done English and chemistry in a few days.

Today, I forced Jason to do the dishes because it was my birthday. My grandpa then told him that I’d do the dishes on his birthday, to which he replied “You’re not even gonna be here” 😦

I find myself constantly thinking about 10 years down the road – I will be 28! Will I be married? With children? What universities will I have attended? Where will I be working? Where will I live? At times, I get super stressed out about my future. Everyone says that my actions in senior year will shape how the rest of my life looks. Yes, the future is scary, but I’ve learned to embrace it.

I promised myself at the beginning of this year that I would try to blog, journal, and reflect as much as possible (although journaling isn’t going very well). I often forget to appreciate the little things amidst all the stress. This year, I feel like I matured a lot. I like to think that I became less judgmental and naive, and maybe a little more relaxed and spontaneous. I’ve still got a lot of life’s journey ahead of me, a lot of things I need to learn. But I’m happy with who I am and who I will continue to become. Although time is a social construct and being 18 shouldn’t mean anything special, I can’t help looking forward to the adventure adulthood will bring.
