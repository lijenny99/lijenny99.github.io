In software engineering, I had developed a routine of being independent. I would go to class (by the end of the semester, alone), copy my calc prof’s diagrams, study in the library (usually the same one), bus home, and repeat. I had little social interaction during the day, and the people I conversed with the most were my roommates.

Business school is quite the contrary.

25-35% of my grade in all my courses are based on contribution. I have to talk in class every day. On top of that, I found myself conversing during the 20-minute breaks too, whether it was with my section-mates or girls in the long washroom lines.

Everyone in our year ends class around the same time. Everyone is in the same building. When the clock strikes 1:00, chaos erupts as people scramble to buy lunch, prep for an interview, or change for an info session. It’s almost impossible to find a spot to sit and eat, let alone a *quiet* one—somewhere I wouldn’t be interrupted by friends walking past every 2 minutes.

It was a hard adjustment. While I loved the case-based style of learning, it was tiring to be constantly “prepared” for class the next day. I also wasn’t used to the social environment that was vastly different from my old engineering classes. On the second day of school, I remember feeling extremely drained. I yearned alone time away from the “hustle” mentality the building radiated.

With my roommates being in different sections, they became the people I talked to the least. Despite all waking up at the same time, we each go about our own days, then come home to shower, brush, and get ready to repeat the same routine again.

I got so caught up in the change. The weeks always felt too long while the days felt too short. I could never tackle every item on my to-do list. At the same time, I constantly found myself thinking back to a previous case or assignment or exam and realizing it had only been seven days since I touched it.

*“That felt like a century ago,”* I would often say.

Because of that, I barely realized it was already fall. Thanksgiving was right around the corner. Soon enough, I was on my way home for the long weekend.

On the drive back, traffic was heavy. Google Maps suggested a detour off the highway along some country roads. Sitting in the passenger seat, it was the first time I noticed how red the leaves had gotten. Streaks of yellow and orange starkly contrasted the bright blue sky. We passed a pumpkin patch, apple farm, and cornfields. Plans to find time to decorate for Halloween, or perhaps pickup some cider on the way back, were discussed in passing.

Before I knew it, we were back on the 401, cruising at 120 to get back in time for a networking event hours later.

 I spent a solid chunk of time in the last few weeks with my head down. “Grinding.” Whether it was for a job, an exam, or an extra-curricular. Since all my classes are in the same building, I take the same path to and from school every day. One straight, direct, ten minute walk. I prefer studying on campus, so it’s usually dark out by the time I’m finally on my way home.

I hadn’t even realized the seasons changed.

This weekend is a well needed break, and a reminder to slow down, catch up with friends, and be thankful.
