      <h2 class="role">Personal Project</h2>
      <br>
      <span class="projects-body">
        In an effort to learn more about UI/UX design and front-end web development, I pursued a personal project of redesigning
        the website for <a class="linked" href="https://www.snapchat.com/l/en-gb/" target="_blank">Snapchat</a>. I designed this website
        with desktop in mind, since most mobile users would likely directly visit the Apple App Store or Google Play Store
        to receive more information. Despite this, the website is still reponsive for all devices.
        <br>
        <br>
        I began the project by sketching out some initial designs in my sketchbook. Inspiration for the initial landing page
        came from the Bootstrap element "jumbotron", which involves large text and a call to action button in front of
        a background image. Afterwards, the drawings were transfered to digital design. I used Sketch and Invision to prototype
        the screens of my project. This was my first time using both programs, and it proved to be a rewarding learning experience.
        The final protype can be viewed <a class="linked" href="https://invis.io/CBF80FDUQ" target="_blank">here</a>, and images of the initial
        screen designs can be seen below.

      <div class="column-2">
        <div class="content">
          <img src="../img/snapchat-1.png" style="width:100%">
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="column-2">
        <div class="content">
          <img src="../img/snapchat-2.png" style="width:100%">
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="column-2">
        <div class="content">
          <img src="../img/snapchat-3.png" style="width:100%">
        </div>
      </div>

      </div>
      <br>
      Finally, I challenged myself to transfer my design into a website. Through this, I was able
      to expand my knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap to build my first ever
      responsive website (the code for the final design can be viewed <a class="linked" href="https://github.com/lijenny99/Snapchat-Website-Redesign" target="_blank">
      here</a>). Although it's only a simple, one page site, it took me a few days to create, refine, and finally
      be satisfied with the final product. Through this project, I became more interested in front-end web development
      and design and will likely pursue more projects in the near future. Stay tuned.
