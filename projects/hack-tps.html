      <h2 class="role">Hackathon - Hack Toronto Police Services (June 2018)</h2>
      <br>
      <span class="projects-body">
        HackTPS is was a three-day hackathon, hosted by <a class="linked" href="http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/" target="_blank">Toronto Police Services (TPS)</a>
        , in collaboration
        with the City of Toronto, Equitech, and the <a class="linked" href="https://dmz.ryerson.ca/" target="_blank">Ryerson DMZ.</a>
        We were challenged to use ground breaking technologies to enhance real-time data and information
        to empower the community and build solutions for persistent safety issues.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our team began by analyzing the core problems that the TPS currently face. We came across one common
        theme: 911 receives a significant volume of requests each day. We identified the core problems as
        <ol>The TPS experience a daily number of 70 to 80 calls a day, which are not high priority calls.
        <ol>Police have to deal with situations they shouldn’t have to deal with or aren’t priorities.
        <ol>Too many people calling 911 means emergencies get put on hold.
        <br>
        <br>
        From there, 
        <br>
        <br>

        Our team created a React Native mobile app that allows streamlined report filing and live chat
        with community responders, reducing redundant 911 calls and wasted human resources.

      Finally, I challenged myself to transfer my design into a website. Through this, I was able
      to expand my knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap to build my first ever
      responsive website (the code for the final design can be viewed <a class="linked" href="https://github.com/lijenny99/Snapchat-Website-Redesign" target="_blank">
      here</a>). Although it's only a simple, one page site, it took me a few days to create, refine, and finally
      be satisfied with the final product. Through this project, I became more interested in front-end web development
      and design and will likely pursue more projects in the near future. Stay tuned.
