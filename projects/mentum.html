      <p class="subtitle">Overview</p>
      <p>
        <a class="club-links" target="_blank" href="http://mentumqr.com">Mentum</a> is an all-in-one restaurant
        point-of-sale ecosystem that enables businesses to achieve greater restaurant efficiency, customer satisfaction,
        and user growth. From September 2020 until December 2021, I served as the first and lead product designer for
        the startup. I worked closely with two of the founding engineers to redesign the order management system, stock
        editor, and customer-facing kiosk; my work served 50K+ MAUs across all platforms and was featured in 500
        Walmarts across North America.
      </p>

      <p class="subtitle">Order Management System</p>

      <p class="subtitle-italic">Problem Definition</p>
      <p>Mentum was founded in March 2020. They identified a gap in the market that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic
        – restaurants were not equipped to handle deliveries across multiple food ordering platforms. Furthermore, once
        outdoor dining started to open up over the summer, restaurants had to manage both deliveries as well as dine-in
        orders. They built out the MVP quickly, and as a result, the UI was cluttered and poorly designed. My job was to
        reimagine what this platform could look like to better serve our primary user demographic: restaurant owners
        whose first language is not English.</p>

      <p class="subtitle-italic">Project Goals</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove redundant or confusing UI elements in existing app</li>
        <li>Shorten the time it takes for new users to learn and understand how to use the app</li>
        <li>Display information by importance so that at a glance, restaurant owners know which orders should be
          prioritized and what aspects need special attention (eg. allergies)</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="subtitle-italic">Approach and Process</p>
      <p>
        I started by performing an audit on the existing design that was in production. I put myself in the shoes of a
        restaurant owner and walked through the entire user flow of how I would go through each step of the order
        management process: receiving, confirming, preparing, delivering, and processing the payment of the order.
        <br>
        <br>
        In early iterations, I played around with the concept of having a “sticky” incoming orders section that
        restaurant staff would see regardless of which order they have selected. This would allow them to see the most
        urgent task at all times – confirming the order is correct, so that it can be sent to the kitchen to be
        prepared. However, upon presenting this design to users, I was met with a lot of confusion due to the fact that
        a table number was displayed on top of this section. This led them to believe that the incoming orders were tied
        to a particular table, as opposed to the entire restaurant.
        <br>
        <br>
        Moving away from wireframes into a high-fidelity prototype (in dark mode!), I realized the design was very
        text-heavy. For non-English speakers, this presents a challenge and directly goes against goal #2 of reducing
        confusion for new users onboarding onto the product. I chose to display some of the less important information
        through icons and ensured all “action items” were clearly marked as buttons.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the next version, I took the learnings from earlier iterations and removed the incoming orders section. Here,
        I realized that there was an imbalance in the information hierarchy. Specifically, data like contact information
        and the total value of the order is not as important as it may seem. To make it easier for staff to view
        everything at a glance, I shrunk the text and tucked it away. I also decided to use color as a way to separate
        items in different statuses (eg. confirmed, served, paid). This would make it easier for staff to understand
        where each item is in the long flow of the order management process.
        <br>
        <br>
        The final design saw a lot of changes and improvements:
      <ol>
        <li>Removed “confirming” step in the process to reduce friction; orders were now automatically sent to the
          kitchen</li>
        <li>Reduced the amount of color on the screen; orange was used to highlight special user notes, such as
          allergies</li>
        <li>Order’s total value breakdown presented in more detail</li>
        <li>Customer info tab which included information such as name, address, phone number, number of orders, total
          spent, and last order</li>
        <li>Driver info tab which included information such as name and phone number</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <p class="subtitle">Stock Editor</p>
      <p class="subtitle-italic">Problem Definition</p>
      <p>During my time, Mentum signed a partnership with Ghost Kitchen Brands to power their restaurants. They needed a
        product that would allow them to search for items and mark them as in / out of stock across all restaurants they
        manage.</p>

      <p class="subtitle-italic">Project Goals</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Toggle in and out of stock items easily</li>
        <li>Display information in a hierarchical and logical way</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="subtitle-italic">Approach and Process</p>
      <p>I began by understanding the functional requirements and nuances that needed to be displayed. The hierarchy of
        information was to be presented as follows: menu > category > item > modifiers. <br><br>
        Menu referred to the restaurant, category encompassed separation at the restaurant level (eg. for Cinnabon, a
        category would be something like “Classics” or “Specials”). Then, there was the specific item within this menu.
        Finally, modifiers referred to extra information the customer could input if they wanted modifications or
        additions to their order.<br><br>
        An example to illustrate this: Cinnabon (menu) > Classics (category) > Cinnamon Bun (item) > Extra cinnamon
        (modifiers).<br><br>
        From there, I played with the best way to nest this information. I settled on creating an arrow toggling
        function due to the sheer amount of data that needed to be displayed across all restaurants under Ghost Kitchen
        Brands. I also experimented with different color combinations, but settled on something simple and easy to
        follow.

      <p class="subtitle">Order Management System</p>
      <p class="subtitle-italic">Problem Definition</p>
      <p>The kiosk is where customers can place orders in store. At 7 feet tall, there was a portion of space
        at the top and bottom of the hardware that was not touchable for the average person. I was tasked with designing
        this product from scratch.</p>
      <p class="subtitle-italic">Project Goals</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Design for accessibility, modularity, and ease of use </li>
        <li>Enable customers to make one order across multiple restaurants</li>
        <li>Find a creative way to use non-touchable and non-viewable space</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="subtitle-italic">Approach and Process</p>
      <p>Early on, I explored some creative ways to display all the necessary information. Similar to the stock editor,
        there were four layers of information that had to be presented: menu/restaurant, category, item, and modifiers.
        I played around with having two carousels for both the restaurant as well as the category, whereas the item and
        modifiers would be displayed in a pop-up on click. I also experimented with different visual styles of
        displaying categories, such as stock photos and stock photo + colors. I wanted to persistently display the
        customer’s order on one side of the screen, but found it difficult to imagine it scaling if there were countless
        modifiers on one item. <br><br>
        By the third and final iteration, I had settled on horizontally scrolling through menu/restaurants on the top
        and vertically scrolling through categories on the left. Items and modifiers were still displayed in a pop-up,
        but now, modifiers were collapsible to improve scalability.

      <p class="subtitle">Challenges</p>
      <ol>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px"><span style="font-weight: 400">Iterating on an existing design</span> – I was
          working directly with the
          engineers who had built out the first version of the app. Thus, whenever I proposed a change that involved
          removing something they spent time making, I faced pushback. To overcome this challenge, I made an active
          effort to perform usability testing and collect feedback on our old vs. new designs. By collecting data and
          insights from the actual customers who would be using them, I was able to present this information to the
          engineers to support my thesis for removing certain UI elements and features.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px"><span style="font-weight: 400">Physical constraints of the kiosk</span> –
          designing for this device was hard. Notably,
          there was a good chunk of
          “wasted space” at the top and bottom of the kiosk where we could not put touch icons because the average
          person would not be able to comfortably reach it. We had to come up with creative ways to use the space, which
          included ads and miscellaneous information (eg. weather, time, etc.).</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: 400">Cohesion across various platforms</span> – as Mentum scaled, they begun to
          brand themselves as an all-in-one
          ecosystem. As I grew to manage the designs for multiple products, it became extremely important for my work to
          be consistent – what are the font sizes for headers, subtext, text? What is the color hierarchy and scheme
          we’re implementing? </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="subtitle">Takeaways and Next Steps</p>
      <p>This was my first time doing freelance design. I learned so much about how to design and build products that
        impacted actual users and businesses, the importance of doing usability testing to validate your hypotheses, and
        how to work cross-functionally to achieve your goals. As for next steps, I would have liked to work on creating
        a design system to develop best practices and coherent styles for the company as they continue to scale. </p>
